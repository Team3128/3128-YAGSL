FRC Team 3128 Robot Control program library classes.

These are the library classes created by the Aluminum Narwhals (FRC Team 3128).
This library is delivered via jar file for use in our robot control programs.

## How to download

Add the file 3128-common.json from this project to the vendordeps directory of your robot project. You can use the
file url from the list above to add to VSCode with the WPILib: Manage Vendor Libraries command. Check the 3128-common version inside that file and set the version you wish to pull from Jitpack. Normally the version in 3128-common.json 
will point to the current release. Recompile while connected to the internet.

Import of Javadocs, source attachment, and jars will be done automatically when building the robot project.

### NOTICE TO DEVELOPERS
Read the documentation in build.gradle for the procedure to do development on this
